            <h2>
                I have explored a variety of artistic media but four years ago I came back to an early love, clay.  My parents were both artists, and our home was filled with objects made by hand.  We sat in chairs that had been made by my father, at the table crafted by his hands.  These cherished things taught me to view a plate or tumbler with respect for the time and consideration invested in its making.  I wanted my work to reflect that same thoughtfulness and inform the user through shape how to hold, use, and find comfort in the vessel.<br /><br />
                For the last 30 years I have made my living in the field of psychology, working with people as they struggle to reshape or remold their lives, to transform themselves.  And I'm creating a similar process with clay. From a mound of mud I fashion a mug, a plate, a bowl.  I want my vessels to bring just a bit more beauty to the day, to the time spent drinking coffee, eating meals, or enjoying flowers.  The pieces I create translate my love for the hand-made to utilitarian objects that charm our daily lives.

                <p>
                    I pursued the making of these technically difficult forms after viewing work by Jerilyn Virden and other ceramic artists.
                    <img class="right" src="images/showbowl.jpg" width="233" height="201" /> The potential of breadth and volume of the pieces intrigue me.
                </p>
                <p> The process begins with throwing two walls, joining them and then altering the form.  While the making is both compelling and challenging the outcomes may surprise the viewer.  The bowls are lighter than the volume suggests.</p>
                <p> I enjoy stretching the clay beyond the traditional bowl form.</p>

                    Judges' Statement</p>

                 <p>   Cups are one of the most important objects we make as potters. It can be an intimate experience to use a cup, mug, tumbler, teabowl, shot glass or any drinking vessel. While most pottery is content to sit on a table, potentially holding food or liquid and occasionally being picked up to use, cups are often caressed with our fingers and ultimately kissed by our lips.
                </p>
                  <p>  I also believe the concept of showing pairs of cups presents the maker with unique possibilities. It is an opportunity to show an active and dynamic relationship between two cups, rather than the static repetition we’re used to seeing in commercial pottery.
                </p>
                  <p>  In selecting the pieces for this exhibit I tried to focus on cups that not only exhibited sensitivity to the user, but also show some rapport with each other. Many of the best cups, however, have illusive qualities that can’t be seen in digital images, such as their feel, weight and volume. I was pleased with the cups I had to choose from and I hope you enjoy this exhibit. In fact I hope you find a pair of cups that inspire you to take them home to be part of your daily ritual…
